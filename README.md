# Series-Photo-Selection

  Implementation of Paperï¼šLEARNING MULTI-SCALE ATTENTIVE FEATURES FOR SERIES PHOTO SELECTION //ICASSP2020   
  
## Introduction
  In this paper, we develop a novel deep CNN architecture that aggregates multi scale features from different network layers, in order to capture the subtle differences between series photos. To reduce the risk of redundant or even interfering features, we introduce the spatial-channel self-attention mechanism to adaptively recalibrate the features at each layer, so that informative features can be selectively emphasized and less useful ones suppressed.   
  
## Structure

   Overview of the proposed deep network architecture for series photo selection. The backbone of our learning algorithm is an end-to-end deep CNN architecture. In our study, features from different network layers are jointly leveraged to help capture the subtle differences between series photos.
